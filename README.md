# Reinforcement Learning Resources and Projects

This repository is to compile a list of useful RL material for myself as well as work on some related projects as well.

The main project I have right now is to use reinforcement learning to train a bot to play Connect Four. Yes, Connect Four is a solved game, but it's a well known children's game and not trivially playable like Tic-Tac-Toe. I felt that it would be a simple way to ease myself into learning.
